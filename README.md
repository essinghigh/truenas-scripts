# TrueNAS Scripts
I cannot guarantee stability or availability of these scripts. I update them as needed for my own use but have decided to share them here in case they are useful to others.

## Available Tools

Here are the available tools in this repository. Each subfolder contains detailed documentation for the specific tool.
